This is the code repository for [Hands-On Machine Learning with TensorFlow.js](https://www.packtpub.com/data/hands-on-machine-learning-with-tensorflow-js), published by Packt.

**A guide to building ML applications integrated with web technology using the TensorFlow.js library**

## What is this book about?
TensorFlow.js is a framework that enables you to create performant machine learning (ML) applications that run smoothly in a web browser. With this book, you will learn how to use TensorFlow.js to implement various ML models through an example-based approach.
Starting with the basics, you'll understand how ML models can be built on the web. Moving on, you will get to grips with the TensorFlow.js ecosystem to develop applications more efficiently. The book will then guide you through implementing ML techniques and algorithms such as regression, clustering, fast Fourier transform (FFT), and dimensionality reduction. You will later cover the Bellman equation to solve Markov decision process (MDP) problems and understand how it is related to reinforcement learning. Finally, you will explore techniques for deploying ML-based web applications and training models with TensorFlow Core. Throughout this ML book, you'll discover useful tips and tricks that will build on your knowledge.
By the end of this book, you will be equipped with the skills you need to create your own web-based ML applications and fine-tune models to achieve high performance.


This book covers the following exciting features:
* Use the t-SNE algorithm in TensorFlow.js to reduce dimensions in an input dataset
* Deploy tfjs-converter to convert Keras models and load them into TensorFlow.js
* Apply the Bellman equation to solve MDP problems
* Use the k-means algorithm in TensorFlow.js to visualize prediction results
* Create tf.js packages with Parcel, Webpack, and Rollup to deploy web apps
* Implement tf.js backend frameworks to tune and accelerate app performance

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
message GraphDef {
  repeated NodeDef node = 1;
  VersionDef versions = 4;
  FunctionDefLibrary library = 2;
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for web developers who want to learn how to integrate machine learning techniques with web-based applications from scratch. This book will also appeal to data scientists, machine learning practitioners, and deep learning enthusiasts who are looking to perform accelerated, browser-based machine learning on Web using TensorFlow.js. Working knowledge of JavaScript programming language is all you need to get started.
